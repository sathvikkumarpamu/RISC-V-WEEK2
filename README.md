üìñ * **BabySoC ‚Äì Fundamentals & Functional Modelling**
Overview
This project is part of Week 2 of the BabySoC learning journey.

The objective is to develop a clear understanding of System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals and to practice functional modelling using simulation tools.

BabySoC serves as a simplified SoC model designed to help learners bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical design flow, preparing them for deeper stages such as RTL design and physical implementation.

üéØ Objectives
Understand the fundamentals of SoC design.

Explore the key components of a typical SoC (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect).

Learn why BabySoC is used as a learning platform.

Apply functional modelling concepts before advancing to RTL and physical design stages.

üß© Key Concepts
What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple components ‚Äî such as a CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects ‚Äî into a single chip, providing a complete computing system.

Components of a Typical SoC
CPU (Processor Core): Executes instructions.

Memory: Stores both code and data.

Peripherals: Interfaces for input/output operations (e.g., UART, timers).

Interconnect (Bus/NoC): Enables communication among system components.

Why BabySoC?
BabySoC is a simplified educational SoC model. It reduces complexity so that learners can focus on the core principles of SoC design before moving on to advanced stages.

Role of Functional Modelling
Functional modelling allows early simulation and verification of system behavior. It ensures correctness before progressing to RTL design and physical implementation.
