* **üõ†Ô∏è RISC-V RTL Workshop**

Welcome to the RTL Workshop!
This is a hands-on learning series focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization. This repository is structured into multiple days, each featuring practical labs, code examples, and in-depth explanations.

üìò About This Workshop
This workshop is designed for students, hobbyists, and engineers aiming to master the practical aspects of modern digital design flow. You will learn about:

Verilog RTL Design and Simulation.

Using Icarus Verilog (iverilog) and GTKWave for simulation and waveform analysis.

Logic synthesis utilizing Yosys and the SKY130 open-source PDK.

Key digital design concepts: Testbenches, timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, and various optimization techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
To ensure a smooth learning experience, please make sure you have:

Basic understanding of digital logic (e.g., gates, flip-flops, multiplexers).

Familiarity with Linux shell commands.

A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS).

Installed tools: git, iverilog, gtkwave, yosys, and a text editor (VS Code recommended).


### üìÇ Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized by day, with each day having a dedicated folder and `README` file detailing labs and concepts.
