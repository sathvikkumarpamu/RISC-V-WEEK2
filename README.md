üìñ**BabySoC ‚Äì Fundamentals & Functional Modelling**
This project is the core focus of 

Week 2 of the BabySoC learning journey. The primary goal is to establish a solid understanding of 

SoC fundamentals and to practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

BabySoC serves as a simplified SoC model designed to help learners bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical design flow, preparing them for deeper stages such as RTL design and physical implementation.

üéØ Objectives
The successful completion of this module aims to develop a clear understanding of System-on-Chip fundamentals. Specifically, learners must:

Build a solid understanding of 

SoC fundamentals.

Understand 

What is a System-on-Chip (SoC).

Explore the 

Components of a typical SoC (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect).

Understand 

Why BabySoC is a simplified model for learning SoC concepts.

Understand 

The role of functional modelling before RTL and physical design stages.

Practice 

functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

üß© Key Concepts (Conceptual Understanding)
This project focuses on the theoretical foundation of SoC design.

What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple components ‚Äî such as a 

CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects ‚Äî into a single chip, providing a complete computing system.

### Components of a Typical SoC

| Component | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU (Processor Core)** | Executes instructions. |
| **Memory** | Stores both code and data. |
| **Peripherals** | Interfaces for input/output operations (e.g., UART, timers). |
| **Interconnect (Bus/NoC)** | Enables communication among system components. |
